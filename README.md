# Weatherapp

For this project I decided to make a Wheather app to fetch weather information from API.
Here is the list of things it has to have and list of things that are nice to have.

## Should have

<i>CSS</i>
*Website needs to be responsive
*Simple logo + paragraph to explain user that he needs to input the city, button to click, search input field + display of the results (that will be created dynamically)


<i>JS</i>
*Fetch API
*error handling 
*Use either data restructuring or dot notations to get data from an object
*Use async await and try and catch
*Search data and display the data for the chosen city
*Data to be dynamically visually displayed: city name, temp, feels_like, humidity
*Inform user if he has entered wrong data (visually)


<i>Git</i>
*Experiment w/ diff branches 
*Push
*Deploy
*Update Readme

## Could have
*Change background based on the weather
*Conversion between temperature scales
