# Weatherapp
<br><br>

For this project I decided to make a Wheather app to fetch weather information from API. <br>
Here is the list of things it has to have and list of things that are nice to have.<br>
<br><br>
## Should have
<br>
<i>CSS</i>
<br>
* Website needs to be responsive <br>
* Simple log, paragraph to explain user that he needs to input the city, button to click, search input field, display of the results (that will be created dynamically) <br>

<br><br>

<i>JS</i><br>
* Fetch API<br>
* error handling <br>
* Use either data restructuring or dot notations to get data from an object<br>
* Use async await and try and catch<br>
* Search data and display the data for the chosen city<br>
* Data to be dynamically visually displayed: city name, temp, feels_like, humidity<br>
* Inform user if he has entered wrong data (visually)<br>
<br><br>

<i>Git</i><br>
* Experiment w/ diff branches <br>
* Push<br>
* Deploy<br>
* Update Readme<br>
<br><br>
## Could have <br>
* Change background based on the weather <br>
* Conversion between temperature scales <br>
